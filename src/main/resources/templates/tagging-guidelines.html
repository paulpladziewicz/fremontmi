        <h2 class="h3">Why Are Tags Important?</h2>
        <p>
            Tags play a crucial role in helping others discover your content on our platform. They act as labels that categorize your posts, businesses, events, or services, making it easier for the Fremont, MI community to find what they're looking for.
            The more accurate and relevant your tags, the more likely your content will be found by those interested.
