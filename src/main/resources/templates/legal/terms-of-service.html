    <h2>Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>All content provided on our platform, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, images, and
        software, is owned by us or our users. You may not use, reproduce, modify, or distribute any content from
        the platform without obtaining permission from the respective owner. By posting content on our platform, you
        grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and worldwide license to use, display, modify, and
        distribute your content in connection with the operation of the platform.</p>
    <p>You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in the content you post. However, you
        represent and warrant that you have the right to grant the license described above and that your content
        does not infringe the rights of any third party.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>Our platform may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We
        do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials,
        products, or services. If you access a third-party website from our platform, you do so at your own risk,
        and you understand that these Terms do not apply to your use of such sites.</p>

    <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the platform will be resolved through binding
        arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will take place in
        Fremont, Michigan, and the decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding. Each party will bear its own
        costs of arbitration, except that the arbitrator may, in their discretion, award costs and fees to the
        prevailing party.</p>
    <p>If arbitration is not permitted by law, any disputes will be resolved exclusively in the state and federal
        courts located in Fremont, Michigan, and you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or
        consequential damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the platform. This includes, but is
        not limited to, any damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if we
        have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
    <p>Our liability to you for any cause of action, regardless of form, will be limited to the amount you paid, if
        any, for using the platform. If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the platform or these Terms, your
        sole remedy is to discontinue using the platform.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising
        the date at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a
        statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). Your continued use of the platform after the
        changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new
        Terms, you must stop using the platform.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the platform at any time, with or without cause, with or without
        notice. Upon termination, your right to use the platform will immediately cease. All provisions of these
        Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including, without limitation,
        ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard
        to its conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
